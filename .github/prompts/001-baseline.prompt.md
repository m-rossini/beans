# Baseliene Prompt for Beans Project
I want to create a baseline code. That baseline code will be a generic thing to start the project and the foundations for running it.
It has to have:
- The code is about simulating unicelular beans life cycle.
- A package structure that separates business logic, configuration, and main execution script
- A Main script that will be run
- It must capture parameters from command line that are initially:
    - --config-file: Path to a configuration file (string)
    - --log-lelvel: Logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING) (string)
- It must have logging configured based on the log-level parameter
- The configuraiton file could be in JSON and must contain at least:
    - Configuration should ideally be split between ebans configuration and world configuration elements
    - World Configuration
        - male and female sprite color
        - male and female ratio
        - Sprite bean size
        - population density for initial calculation of beans quantity
        - Placement strategy of the beans
    - Beans Configuration
        - maximum bean age  
        - Speed range (min and max), negative speeds imply backwards movement
    - for non informed parameters, default values must be used
- Business logic and config files live in different packages/modules
- I want the classes representing game elements example, world, bean, etc.. to be in their own modules
- The game elements classes DO NOT contain display or rendering logic, they will be wrapped by classes that
- The relationship beteween the elements and rendering classes will be:
    - World class will be wrapped by a class
    - Bean class will be wrapped by a class  
- The engine that renders the class is arcade
- The main script will initialize the game by:
    - loading the configuration from the file
    - setting up the logging
    - creating the world instance based on the configuration
    - starting the arcade window to render the world
- Placement of the beans inside the world will follow a streategy that will be configured and implemented by specific classes:
    - RandomPlacementStrategy
    - GridPlacementStrategy
    - ClusteredPlacementStrategy
    - Each bean wuill have an initial position based on the placement strategy and a direction based on random angle
- The project must have a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file that includes all dependencies
