# Post Work Guidelines
- After completing the coding task, review the code for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure all tests pass and that code coverage is satisfactory.
- Always create a summary of the work done, and that summary should be at most 1 page long ideally smaller.
- The summary should include:
  - A brief overview of the problem solved
  - Key design decisions made
  - Any challenges faced and how they were overcome
  - Instructions on how to run the code and tests
  - It should resemble an ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
  - It should be like a specification not a narrative of what was done neither a refactorig wash list.
- Save it as a .md file in summaries sub directory that is just under the root directory
- Start the name with a data in the form YYYY-MM-DD-{some proper identifiable name}
- Whenever make sense, alongside the summary, create a mermaid diagram, in the same directory, of the implemented solution
- Link the diagram in the summary file
- Use proper mermaid syntax and ensure the diagram renders correctly in GitHub markdown preview
- Finally after creating the summaries and diagrams, commit them.
