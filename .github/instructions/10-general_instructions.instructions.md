This file outlines STRICT abnd HARD rules that must be followed to the letter when using agents to code.
Below is a list of different files covering different topics that MUST be followed

## General Isntructions

Follow the instrucitons on this sections and the the instrucitons on each file.

- When python, ensure you are on the correct environment
- When Asked a question, never change or add code, always ANSWER and give an educated answer with pros and cons of your choice
- When in doubt, ask clarification questions. Do not assume, ask.
- Stick to the request, do not go beyond what is asked.
- Always use the commands in the make file. If they are not there please suggest adding them

## Procedures
- Always plan first
- Divide the problem in phases
- For each phase create a TODO list
- For each TODO item create a plan of attack
- Implement each TODO item one at a time
- Each phase should be a different branch
- After each phase commit and ask if it is to push or not 
- After push ask for a PR and for a nudge when PR was merged
